### Reference Documentation Pages

All installation information can be found on the Python or Conda docs so these links are an exact copy of those found in the <a href="https://hernandezj1.github.io/hpced/Docs/4_1_Environments/">4.1-Environments docs</a> with additional outside references.

<a href="https://docs.rcc.fsu.edu/software/python/">Python Overview Docs</a>

<a href="https://docs.rcc.fsu.edu/software/conda/">Conda & Anaconda RCC Docs</a>

Both of the following links are general docs. Please reference our documentation first and use these for advanced use cases that we do not cover.

<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/">Pip user guide</a>

<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/packages/install-packages/">Guide to install conda packages</a>
